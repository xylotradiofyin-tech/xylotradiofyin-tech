### 🎨 How I Approach Frontend Development

I build UIs that feel smooth, intuitive, and structured.  
My approach is grounded in:

- Component-driven design and clarity of layout
- Accessible and responsive interfaces across devices
- Modern CSS systems like **Tailwind** for consistency and speed
- Performance-focused architectures with **Next.js**

> I see UI as a balance between logic and aesthetics — the best experiences are simple, clear, and effortless to use.
